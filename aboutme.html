    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here?
I'm preparing for the algebra 2 test right now because I heard from the teacher that it's difficult. I was bad at algebra 1 so I don’t want to fail and become a super senior.

How am I working toward these goals?
Last week I attended math tutoring during lunch. I didn’t learn much because the teacher talked a lot, and I couldn’t focus.

What values do I consider most necessary for my success?
 Something I consider most necessary for my success is being able to work together with other. And being able to focus when I need to.

What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?
A short term I have is to pass algebra 2 so that I can get one step closer to graduating high school. Another short-term goal I have is to be able to afford lighting mc queen crocs so that I can be a cool kid amongst my friends.

What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?
One achievement I want to be known for is going to community college and still getting a decent job :D. Most my friends said that community college sucks so that why I want to do it.(and i want to know why it sucks)
